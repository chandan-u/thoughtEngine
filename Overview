This is a simple log application, developed with the idea of logging personal thoughts/ideas etc

1.) so the first idea is to create a blog -------- private(diary) and public will be blog [so its kind of a log]
2.) the second idea is to implement a thought engine to log all my thoughts
    for ex: what I want to do...and probably why I wanna do too
